      Privacy Policy
    </h1>
    <p>
      This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”), effective as of 01/01/2016 (The "Effective Date") is provided to inform you of our policies and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and how that information is used. Please see the Notification of Changes to this Privacy Policy section below for information regarding changes to this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact TheGuarantor Assistant by e-mail at guarantorassistant@gmx.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      TheGuarantor Assistant (“Company” or “we”) is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the Company’s website, located at www.guarantorassistant.com (the “Site”). We collect information about you when you sign-up for newsletters, special promotions, or initiate requests for information regarding the Company’s services (“Service(s)”).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Information We Collect and Use.
    </p>
    <p>
      As discussed in this Privacy Policy, “information” means information about you collected through our website(s), including your email address and other information you provide to us by registering for our Services or making requests for information about our Services. Any information provided to us will be retained and used solely for the purposes of fulfilling your request for information, fulfilling a request through a Site feature, performing and carrying out the terms of the Service, or communicating with you as a client or subscriber of Company Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Methods of Collection of Information. We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you access the Site or use or access the Services. We may also collect personally identifiable information from you through a number of voluntary sources on the Site or through the Services, including through emails or other communications sent through the Services. The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will include, by way of example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Domain name and Internet Protocol (IP) address;</li>
      <li>E-mail address;</li>
      <li>Contact information (including, name, address, zip code, country, and phone number);</li>
      <li>Gender;</li>
      <li>Social-security number;</li>
      <li>Financial information, such as account or credit card numbers;</li>
      <li>User-specific and aggregate information on areas of the Site accessed and the Services used;</li>
      <li>Other information you volunteer to the Site, through the Services or through other means of communication, such as responses, registrations, surveys, reviews, comments, confirmations, emails, postings, messages, telephone calls, written correspondence or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to the Site or through the Services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      General, Non-Personal Information. From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as “cookies” and “IP addresses”, which are discussed in greater detail below. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and Service to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retention of Personal Information. TheGuarantors Agency will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will make good faith efforts to delete the data if you contact us by following the instructions at the end of this Privacy Policy, provided the Company is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.
    </p>
    <p>
      IP Addresses. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the web. Web servers, the computers and software that store, process and deliver web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for the purpose of system administration, to report aggregate information to third parties, and to track the use of the Site. When visitors request pages from the Site or click on a link in a mailing sent through the Service, our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses. We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor or list member when it will enhance the users experience or if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s policies or to protect Company, the Site, its visitors, the Service, our Internet Service Provider partners, the list members or others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that websites transfer to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes, and to save website preferences. Cookies are commonly used by businesses with an internet presence.
Cookies are not used to store personal information, or to retain historical or transactional subscriber data. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Information such as the total number of visitors and pages viewed is most easily tracked with cookies. We may use the information from cookies to make improvements and updates to the Site and to tailor our services to our visitors’ needs. You always have the option of disabling cookies using your web browser preferences. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, please be aware that some features of the Site will not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear Gifs (Web Beacons / Web Bugs). A Clear GIF is a tiny line of code, only 1 by 1 pixel in size, that is programmed to collect certain information about a visit to a particular website. We may use clear GIFs to gather non-personal, aggregate information on visits to our Sites, track usage of website links and email delivery. We do not disclose personal information that may be linked to our clear GIF collection practices to third parties. The Sites are not responsible for the use of clear GIFs by other website operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Profile. We store information that we collect through cookies and clear gifs to create a “profile” of your preferences. We tie your personal information to information in the profile to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers or to improve the content of the Site for you. We do not share your profile with third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information Sharing and Disclosure. Except for the limited situations listed here in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with third parties. To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agents and Third Party Service Providers. To provide the Company’s Services to you, we may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain specialized services such as data processing or other technology services. In such instances, we may provide your personal information to those businesses but they are not permitted to retain or use your information for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change of Control / Asset Transfer. As the Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell all or parts of our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that the assets of the Company in whole or in parts are acquired by a third-party, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Site or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets. In the event of a corporate change in control or sale of all or parts of our business assets, the buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.
      <br><br>Communication From the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Customer Service. Based upon the information you provide to us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the Services you request, and to manage your account relating to Company Services. We may communicate with you by email or telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newsletters and Promotions. We may provide you the opportunity to opt-in to additional newsletters or promotional communications sent by email. If you have opted in or otherwise qualify to receive these forms of communication, we will use your name and email address to communicate with you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe, as established in the “Choice and Opt-out” section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choice/Opt-out. We may provide you the opportunity to opt-in to additional newsletters or promotional communications sent by email. If you have opted in or otherwise qualify to receive these forms of communication, and no longer wish to receive our newsletter or other promotional communications by email, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security and Information Protection. The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our payment forms, we encrypt that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Further, we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. That said, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firewalls. When we store information that you have provided to us when registering for the Service, that information is protected by security measures that include “firewalls” (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and other tools such as data encryption and physical security, where appropriate. No data transmission over the Internet or data repository can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Company strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Links to Other Sites. Please be aware that when you are on the Site, or when you receive an email message from us through the Service, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other sites from the Site’s pages or from the email message we send to you that take you outside our Site. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data, or solicit personal information. The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there. Note that when you link to a third party site from the Site, you may see pre-populated data fields with your personal information; however, that information is not available to the third party unless you take certain actions on the third party’s site, such as submitting a form.
      <br><br>Legal Compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Company reserves the right to disclose member information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Company’s rights or property, other visitors, list members, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Company also reserves the right to disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
      <br><br>Notification of Changes to this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the homepage of the Site for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made, that this Privacy Policy has been updated, and by changing the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Site and participation in following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
