    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>
      TheGuarantor Assistant gives you the ability to perform certain activities and gather certain information at our site(s) on the World Wide Web (the “Site”). You can use the Site to gather certain information about our products and services, to apply online for one or more of our products and services, and for certain educational content (“Online Activities”).
    </p>
    <p>
      When you access the Site, you’re agreeing to these terms and conditions of use, plus any additional terms or conditions within the Site itself (collectively “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions are in addition to any other agreements between you and TheGuarantor Assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      TheGuarantor Assistant reserves the right to modify or change the Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice to you. Such modification or change shall be effective upon posting by TheGuarantor Assistant on the Site. You agree to be bound to any changes to these Terms and Conditions when you use the Site after any such change is posted.
      <br><br>Your Privacy and security on the site.
      <br><br>Updating Your Personal Information
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for telling TheGuarantor Assistant if you’ve changed your personal information, such as your name, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address, or other personal information. You may update your personal information by using the Online Activities or by contacting TheGuarantor Assistant at guarantorassistant@gmx.com

      <br><br>Online Access
    </p>
    <p>
      For some Online Activities, TheGuarantor Assistant permits “Online Access,” which includes the ability to use a personal computer or other access device equipped with an active connection to an Internet Service Provider to access your TheGuarantor Assistant accounts, policies, or other products and to perform certain transactions as available. You may register for Online Access via the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to conduct some Online Activities, you agree to receive information applicable to your use of the Online Activities delivered to you electronically. These may include policy documents, quotes, billing statements, updates, notifications or other information that you request, transaction receipts, documents requiring your signature, or any other documents (“Communications”). Your consent does not mean that TheGuarantor Assistant must provide the Communications electronically; TheGuarantor Assistant may, at its option, provide the Communications through non-electronic means. As part of the Online Activities, many of these Communications are made available to you in non-electronic form. If you wish to withdraw your consent to receive information electronically through your use of the Online Activities, you may discontinue your use of the Online Access. If you have questions regarding Online Activities, please contact TheGuarantor Assistant at guarantorassistant@gmx.com
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of the Online Activities, you may be given the option to sign certain Communications electronically by either checking the appropriate box or engaging in a similar online process as instructed online. You agree that by checking the appropriate box within or adjacent to the applicable Communication or engaging in a similar online electronic signature process, you are providing your electronic signature and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions in such Communication just as if you had signed your name to a paper document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your state may require insurance documents to be displayed in a particular font size. To ensure that Communications are displayed at the correct font size for your state, please make sure that the view size setting for the Communications is set to 100% and your browser resolution is 800 x 600.
      <br><br>System Requirements
    </p>
    <p>
      To receive, access, and reply to applicable Communications you will need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a personal computer or other access device with Internet access,</li>
      <li>a web browser which is capable of supporting 128-bit SSL encryption,</li>
      <li>software that lets you get and open Portable Document Format or “PDF” files, and</li>
      <li>the ability to download or print agreements and disclosures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      System Requirements to Retain Information
    </p>
    <p>
      To retain the Communications sent to you electronically for your records, your system must have the ability to download (e.g., to your hard disk drive or a floppy diskette), print PDF files, or print web pages and embedded HTML files. In some cases, you must print, complete, and sign Communications with a pen, and then return them to TheGuarantor Assistant according to the instructions on the document. To do this, you must have a functioning printer connected to your personal computer or other access device that is able to print Communications and the instructions on plain, white 8½ x 11 inch paper.
